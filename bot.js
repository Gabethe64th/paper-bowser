There is a high chance it will be permanently disabled.\n\nWhat about this Discord?\nIf I really get banned, @Deleted User and my other alt accounts will be banned from Discord. Creating any further accounts would be seen as ban evasion, so they will be banned as well. I am basically gone from Discord then. I will not return most likely. Might visit once in a while.\nI will give admin powers to Soulavenger, after that he will be able to claim ownership of the server. He and the mods will lead this community equally. Anything beyond that is nothing I could do anything about. They're in your hands then, and I think it will be okay. If you're worried about the community disappearing I would advise you to make little servers with your best friends yourself.\nI do not think this discord will have any relation to the stream anymore then, however.\n\nWhat about the stream?\nThat's the big question here. Discord is very essential for my work, for communication/organization, and so on. I think many of you would like to see me continue doing the stream, but I am not sure how feasible it would be. However, I have no plans to turn it off anytime soon, so don't worry about that. I am also not sure what the mods think about modding the stream at this point. I know some of them already do not want anything to do with me anymore, unfortunately. I would like to keep it running for as long as possible, but I just don't know how I could do it without Discord... I'll continue thinking about this.\nI'm sorry I'm not talking much more about why I'm getting banned, as it is a fairly private issue.\n\nI know a statement like this doesn't really make anything better.

No matter how green the grass could be, or how tall the trees can get, no one would want to live in such a place without any form of protection. That didn't stop three people from picking that place as their new home, though. These three were given a simple mission: Survive. With their given resources and skills, at seems like a cakewalk at first glance. However, not everything is as it seems. One of the people, an old man called by his people with the name 'Nokobo', took one big sniff of his new habitat before looking back at his teammates.\n"Ah, nothing like the fresh smell of death!" He gleefully shouted at the trees behind the engaged couple; the Pirate Doctor named Irri, and his wife, the careless hunter named Cain.\n"The crickets around this place are awfully loud." The huntress quickly complained, darting her eyes around the surrounding trees, looking for anything that she can grab for dinner.\n"Good!" Nokobo replied, "That means it's time to stop lounging around and finally build a shelter. Irri, the blueprints, please."\nWithout hesitation, the horned doctor handed the old man a blue piece of paper. And with one quick glance at the plan, he got started on cutting down the nearby trees...

Irri gives off a smile of pure happiness.\n"You-You woke me up for this?" Cain's tired and grumpy voice informed Irri's smile to fade away.\n"Well, it's also sunrise, dear. C'mon, we have a full day ahead of us."\nCain groaned in disgust, reflecting on the week she had to put up through. First, she had to get used to the new environment, then she was given the job as the food hunter for the team, and now, there's a cat on her bed. But she wasn't too bothered on the second part, though. Shooting stuff is her specialty, even when the target begins to beg for mercy. After one more minute of lazing about on the bed, she hops off to reach for her gun, which was at its usual place of being under the bed, before walking out of her wooden cabin, followed by her new pet.\n"CAAIN, I'M HUNGRYYY!" The voice of an old man next to an unfinished kitchen whimpered loudly in the near distance.\n"Not my fault." Cain checked the number of remaining bullets in her gun, scaring away the cat that was behind her in the process with its noise. No ammo.\n"Ugh. What does it take to have good guns here?"\n"Time." Irri walked towards Cain with a blueprint in his hands, "A lot of time, unfortunately."\n"Then hurry up." Cain snapped. \n"Hah! Welcome to the new world!" Nokobo joked while nailing together two flimsy boards of wood. Truly, there's a lot of work to do if they want to continue on in this world. But for now, it's just three people stranded in a jungle...preparing themselves for one hell of a journey they're about to take.`);

For example, something that hits harder has a larger ‚Äúbruh mass,‚Äù such as karen taking the kids as opposed to spilling your drink. The faster something hits is known to have a larger ‚Äúbruh velocity,‚Äù such as a fast moving train vs the slow inevitability of death as it crushes our very souls second by second and we‚Äôll eventually succumb to the cold embrace of the Reaper himself.
